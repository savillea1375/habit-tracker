# Habit Tracker

## By Aiden Saville

I like to be organized and consistent, which is why I made this app. Every time I complete a task for the day,
I mark it off in the app. The grid view represents the entire year with little boxes, and a box is grey if the
task did not get completed that day and green if it did. Before making this app, I used to do this in a Google
Sheet document and it worked fine but I figured since I can make an app that does the same thing, why not?
This app also makes it much easier since I don't have to format cells to represent days and mess with formulas.
