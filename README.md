# Habit Tracker
## By Aiden Saville

I like to be organized and consistent, which is why I made this app. Every time I
complete a recurring task for the day, I mark it off and is shown as complete on the grid view.
The grid view represents the entire year with little boxes, and a box is grey if the task did not get
completed that day and green if it did. Before making this app, I used to this in a Google Sheet document,
but this app makes it much easier since I don't have to format cells and mess with formulas.
