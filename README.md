# Habit Tracker

## By Aiden Saville

I like to be organized and consistent, which is why I made this app. I used to use a Google Sheet to track my habits and if I completed it for each day. With the app, all I need to do is mark the checkbox next to the habit I completed and it adds the entry to the database. Each habit also features a grid-calendar view made up of boxes. Each box represents a day and is green if the user did that habit that day or red if they didnt'. There is also a stats tab that shows you your overall stats, such as completions by day for the past 30 days, ratio of completions to misses. The app was built using Expo and Supabase.
